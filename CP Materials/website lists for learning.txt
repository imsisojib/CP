#Number Theory (Part 1, Part 2): Hackerearth.com
	Modular Arithmetic Basics
	Modular Exponentiation (computing $x^n % m$ in $\log n$
	GCD in $\log n$
	Modular Multiplicative Inverse,

#Greedy: Hackerearth.com
	Developing intuition for greedy algorithms/proving or knowing their correctness
	for a question comes with practice
	
#Binary Search: Hackerearth.com
	Some of my favorite questions are on Binary Search! It’s a nice topic, and 
	questions based on it can be pretty good if the monotonicity of the function 
	isn’t obvious.
